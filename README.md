Expenses calculator

I would like to create a project based on user input, such as the one described in example 6. I'd like to develop a code that takes a list of expenses and calculate the amount everyone owes to each other. 
I can take the dutch app 'Wie betaalt wat' as an example for the functions of the project. With this app you are able to create a group to calculate the amount of money everybody owes to each other. 
The difference is that in this app, you can add expenses for anyone at any time, so there are no lists. To create data, I will use the 'Wie betaalt wat' group from my own house to create a excel file with different
expenses from people.
